      <h2>South Windsor Parks and Recreation</h2>
      <p><i>June 2024-August 2025</i></p>
      <p>I worked as a summer camp counselor for South Windsor Parks and Rec. I worked for both Camp Discovery and Trail Blazers. I created engaging games for campers ages 5-11 during my time as a camp counselor. For about half of last summer, I served as a Specialist where I design my own activities, helped resolve interpersonal conflict between couselors, and aided the camp directors. </p>

      <h2>Watertown Youth Hockey</h2>
      <p><i>September 2021-November 2024</i></p>
      <p>I volunteered as a youth hockey coach for children ages 3-9. I taught the children hockey basics (skating, stick-handling, shooting) and worked one on one with the children who were really struggling with skating. I collaborated with the other coaches to create fun drills and games for the players. </p>
