Welcome to my personal site. 

I have built this by scratch using AI and online tutorials to aid me.

The pages folder contains all of the html documents. 
The images folder contains all the images used in the website.
The css folder contains all of the css files used to format the htlm documents. 
The js folder contains a javascript file that dynamically loads the navbar into each html page

The index.html file is at the root along with this the pdf file of my resume and readme.md file.
