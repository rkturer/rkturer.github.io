        <h2>Movie Recommender Back-End!</h2> 
        <p>I cleaned a free data set from MovieLens using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. The project runs in the terminal taking a user input for 
          the desired genre and number of recommendations. The program returns those titles and then uses an API to offer the user where they can
          rent, stream, or purchase the titles in the United States of America! Currently, I am developing a front-end for the program which I hope to 
          finish in November!</p>

        <p>I created this website from scratch. I used AI and other online resources to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
